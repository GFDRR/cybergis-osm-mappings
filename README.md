CyberGIS OSM Mappings (cybergis-osm-mappings)
================

## Description

This repository contains OSM mappings for use by GeoGit.  See the "Using GeoGit wish OpenStreetMap Data" page for more information at: [http://geogit.org/docs/interaction/osm.html](http://geogit.org/docs/interaction/osm.html).  The mappings folder includes the mappings in json format.  The mappings are broken out into namespaces/categories, mostly following ISO categories.

See the guides in the cybergis-guides repo at [https://github.com/state-hiu/cybergis-guides/](https://github.com/state-hiu/cybergis-guides), for examples on use these mappings.

### CyberGIS
The Humanitarian Information Unit has been developing a sophisticated geographic computing infrastructure referred to as the CyberGIS. The CyberGIS provides highly available, scalable, reliable, and timely geospatial services capable of supporting multiple concurrent projects.  The CyberGIS relies on primarily open source projects, such as PostGIS, GeoServer, GDAL, GeoGit, OGR, and OpenLayers.  The name CyberGIS is dervied from the term geospatial cyberinfrastructure.

### ROGUE
The Rapid Opensource Geospatial User-Driven Enterprise (ROGUE) Joint Capabilities Technology Demonstration (JCTD) is a two-year research & development project developing the technology for distributed geographic data creation and synchronization in a disconnected environement.  See [http://rogue.lmnsolutions.com](http://rogue.lmnsolutions.com) for more information.  HIU is leveraging the technology developed through ROGUE to build out the CyberGIS into a robust globally distributed infrastruture.
