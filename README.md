Nepal Earthquake Response OSM Mappings (cybergis-osm-mappings)
================

## Description

This repository contains OpenStreetmap (OSM) mappings for use by GeoGig.  See the "Using GeoGig with OpenStreetMap Data" page for more information at: [http://geogig.org/docs/interaction/osm.html](http://geogig.org/docs/interaction/osm.html).  The mappings folder includes the mappings in json format.  The mappings are broken out into namespaces/categories, mostly following ISO categories.  These are standardized mappings that should represent most basic OSM features, but also cover common mispellings and mistaggings.


This project was initially developed for use by the State Department Humanitarian Unit.  The repository you are looking at has been forked by GFDRR for use in supporting the response to the April 25 2015 Nepal Earthquake.

## Installation

These installation instructions are subject to change.  Right now, since there are no debian package dependencies, you can really extract the repo to whatever directory you want.  The instructions below are suggested as they mirror Linux best practices for external packages.

As root, execute the following commands:
```
cd /opt
git clone https://github.com/state-hiu/cybergis-osm-mappings.git cybergis-osm-mappings.git
```

The CyberGIS Scripts repo (cybergis-scripts) also contains some tools for automating the process of creating OpenStreetMap extracts.  See the installation guide at [https://github.com/state-hiu/cybergis-scripts](https://github.com/state-hiu/cybergis-scripts).

## Usage

Extents are currently limited to bounding boxes in the `S W N E` format to conform closely to the `osm download` command explained in the [Downloading data from an OSM Server](http://geogig.org/docs/interaction/osm.html#downloading-data-from-an-osm-serve) section of the GeoGig User Manual.  Complex geometry extents are possible but are not sufficiently integrated to work at scale.  You can do complex geometry extents, but it currently requires hand writing filters using the [Overpass Query Language](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Overpass_API/Language_Guide).

The easist mapping to start with is the `basic:buildings_and_roads` mapping available at [[link]](https://github.com/state-hiu/cybergis-osm-mappings/blob/master/mappings/basic/buildings_and_roads.json).

You can learn more about OSM mappings from the GeoGig User Manual at [http://geogig.org/docs/interaction/osm.html#data-mapping](http://geogig.org/docs/interaction/osm.html#data-mapping).
